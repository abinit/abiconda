    description: |
        ABINIT is a package whose main program allows one to find the total
        energy, charge density and electronic structure of systems made of 
        electrons and nuclei (molecules and periodic solids) within 
        Density Functional Theory (DFT), using pseudopotentials and a planewave
        or wavelet basis. ABINIT also includes options to optimize the geometry 
        according to the DFT forces and stresses, or to perform molecular dynamics 
        simulations using these forces, or to generate dynamical matrices,
        Born effective charges, and dielectric tensors, based on Density-Functional
        Perturbation Theory, and many more properties. Excited states can be computed 
        within the Many-Body Perturbation Theory (the GW approximation and the 
        Bethe-Salpeter equation), and Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory
        (for molecules). In addition to the main ABINIT code, different  utility programs are provided.
